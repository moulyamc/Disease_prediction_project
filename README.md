# Disease Prediction Project

## 🧠 Overview
A Python-based machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of chronic diseases based on user-input symptoms. It uses classification algorithms and a simple GUI for input, making it beginner-friendly and easy to demo.

## 🔍 Features
- Predicts disease based on symptom inputs
- Trained using Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naïve Bayes
- Simple GUI built with Tkinter
- Preprocessed training and test datasets
- Outputs most probable disease with accuracy score

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python
- Tkinter
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- NumPy
