# 🩺 Disease Prediction Project

A simple GUI-based system that predicts diseases based on symptoms using Machine Learning. Built during an internship at Varcons Technologies Pvt Ltd.

---

## 🧠 Features
- Predicts one of 41 diseases based on symptoms
- GUI built using Tkinter
- Uses Naive Bayes classifier (Gaussian)
- Trained on a cleaned dataset of 4920 records and 132 features
